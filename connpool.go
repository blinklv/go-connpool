// same pool is a good idea, although they all satisfy the net.Conn interface. All
// network types defined in https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial are not completely
// independent, like tcp4, tcp6 and tcp, the latter includes the former two. There
// will be some extra works to detect network types passed by callers when users
// get connections from a pool, which sacrifices performance. Dividing various kinds
// of connections into different pools won't be harder for users and more efficient.
