// This type defines how to connect to the address. The purpose of designing this
// type is to serve the Pool struct. It's not as common as net.Dial that you can
// specify a network type, which means the type of connections in one pool should
// be same. In fact, I don't think caching different kinds of connections in the
// same pool is a good idea, although they all satisfy the net.Conn interface. All
// network types defined in https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial are not completely
// independent, like tcp4, tcp6 and tcp, the latter includes the former two. There
// will be some extra works to detect network types passed by callers when users
// get connections from a pool, which sacrifices performance. Dividing various kinds
// of connections into different pools won't be harder for users and more efficient.

// The capacity parameter controls the maximum idle connections to keep per-host
