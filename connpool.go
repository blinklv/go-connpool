package connpool

import (

// An implementation of the net.Conn interface. It wraps the raw connection
// created by the dial function you register to rewrite the original Close
// method, which can make you put a connection to the pool implicitly by using
// the Close method instead of calling an pool.Put method explicitly to do
// this. The former is more natural than the latter for users.
type Conn struct {
	net.Conn         // The raw connection created by the dial function you register.
	b        *bucket // The bucket to which this connection binds.
}

// Close the connection. If the pool which this connection binds to isn't
// closed and has enough room, puts the connection to the pool; otherwise,
// release the underlying connection directly (call the raw Close method).

// Release the underlying connection. It will call the Close method of the
// net.Conn field. Although you can invoke the Close method of the net.Conn
// field (exported) by yourself, I don't recommend you do this, cause the
// Release method will do some extra works.
